# citigrapher

The citigrapher repository is a collection of successive weeks of meetups that look at a series of problems geared towards building a tool for deciding on optimum locations for people to meet within London - citigrapher.

Each week a new problem will be posed and an R and Python tutorial written in advance that will demonstrate one way in which a task may be completed. As we approach the end of citigapher we will form a development group who will continue the project outside of the meetups.
